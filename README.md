## Building a Web Site for Developers using Flask

### Overview
The goal is to create a web site that assists other developers in building their own web sites. To achieve this, a Flask application will be designed to provide a platform for sharing resources, tutorials, and a forum for developers to connect and collaborate.

### HTML Files

2. **Tutorials (tutorials.html):** A dedicated page for tutorial articles, organized by subject or difficulty level. Each tutorial includes a title, author, content, and an option for comments and ratings.

3. **Resources (resources.html):** A comprehensive list of resources, such as toolkits, libraries, and frameworks, categorized and described to aid developers in their projects.

4. **Forum (forum.html):** A discussion platform where developers can post questions, share knowledge, and engage in discussions with like-minded individuals. Includes features for creating threads, replying, and voting.

5. **Profile (profile.html):** A private page for each registered user to manage their profile, update their information, and keep track of their contributions to the site.
